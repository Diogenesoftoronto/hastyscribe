## Overview

[](class:hastyscribe) is a self-contained {{mdlink -> [Markdown][df]}} compiler that can create single-file HTML documents. All documents created by {{hs -> HastyScribe}} use well-formed HTML and embed all stylesheets, fonts, and images that are necessary to display them in any (modern) browser (don't even try to display them in IE8 or lower).

In other words, all documents created by HastyScribe are constituted by only one [.HTML](class:ext) file, for easy distribution.

### Rationale

There are plenty of programs and services that can convert {{mdlink}} into HTML but they are typically either too simple --they convert {{md -> markdown}} code into an HTML fragment-- or too complex --they produce a well-formed document, but they require too much configuration, or the installation of additional software dependencies.

Sometimes you just want to write your document in markdown, and get a full HTML file out, ready to be distributed, ideally with no dependencies (external stylesheets or images) --that's where {{hs}} comes in.

{{hs}}:

* lets you focus on content and keeps things simple, while giving you all the power of {{disclink -> [Discount][discount]}}-enriched {{md}} (plus some more goodies).
* takes care of styling your documents properly, making sure they look good on your desktop and even on small screens, ready to be distributed. 
* is a single, small executable file, with no dependencies. To be fair, it's about 1MB in size when compiled for OSX -- but that's only because the {{hs}} executable embeds all the fonts and stylesheets it needs to produce documents.

### Key Features

#### Standard Markdown

{{hs}} supports standard {{md}} for formatting text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber, and used on many web sites and programs to enable users to write HTML code _without actually writing HTML tags_.

> You can learn about Markdown syntax in the [Syntax Reference](#Syntax.Reference) section of this document. Alternatively, you can also read the original [Markdown syntax page][md-syntax] on John Gruber's blog, Daring Fireball.

#### Discount Extensions

Standard markdown is great, but sometimes you wish it had a few more features, like tables or fenced code blocks perhaps. The good news is that under the hood {{hs}} uses {{disclink}}, a markdown compiler library written in C that extends markdown with a few useful extensions, which allow you to, for example:

* format blocks of texts to create [notes](#Notes) and [sidebars](#Sidebars)
* style text using CSS classes
* create definition lists and alphabetical lists

#### Text Snippets

Although not part of neither {{md}} nor Discount, {{hs}} allows you to create text [snippets](#Snippets) to reuse content. Useful when you have to use a sentence or a formatted block of text over and over in a document, or shorten long words (like the word _{{hs}}_ in this document [](class:fa-smile-o)).

#### Image (and font) Embedding

{{hs}} only produces single HTML files. With _no dependencies_:

* By default, the HastyScribe, FontAwesome, Source Sans Pro, and Source Code Pro fonts are automatically embedded.
* All referenced images (both local and remote) are automatically embedded using the {{datauri -> [data URI scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)}}.

#### FontAwesome Icons

[FontAwesome][fa] icons can be used in [badges](#Badges) or simply to customize text. [](class:fa-thumbs-up) 

#### Notes, tips, warnings, sidebars and badges

> %sidebar%
> About notes etc.
> 
> HastyScribe has built-in [tips](#Tips), [notes](#Notes), [warnings](#Warnings), [sidebars](#Sidebars), like this one.

[...and this is a comment badge.](class:draftcomment)

#### Responsive Design

All HTML documents created by {{hs}} are responsive and can be viewed perfectly on small devices.

#### Printed Media Support

{{hs}}'s stylesheet contains styles that are specific for printed media. This means that if you try to print an HTML file generated by {{hs}} it will paginate properly and it will display headers and footers (with page numbers).

## Getting Started

### Downloading Pre-built Binaries

The easiest way to get {{hs}} is by downloading one of the prebuilt binaries from the [Github Release Page][release]:

  * [HastyScribe for Mac OS X (x64)]({{release}}/hastyscribe_v1.1.2_macosx_x64.zip) -- Compiled on OS X Yosemite (LLVM CLANG 6.0)
  * [HastyScribe for Windows (x64)]({{release}}/hastyscribe_v1.1.2_windows_x64.zip) -- Cross-compiled on OS X Yosemite (MinGW-w64 GCC 4.8.2)
  * [HastyScribe for Windows (x86)]({{release}}/hastyscribe_v1.1.2_windows_x86.zip) -- Cross-compiled on OS X Yosemite (MinGW-w64 GCC 4.8.2)
  * [HastyScribe for Linux (x86)]({{release}}/hastyscribe_v1.1.2_linux_x86.zip) -- Cross-compiled on OS X Yosemite (GNU GCC 4.8.1)
  * [HastyScribe for Linux (ARM)]({{release}}/hastyscribe_v1.1.2_linux_arm.zip) -- Cross-compiled on OS X Yosemite (GNU GCC 4.8.2)

### Installing using Nimble

If you already have [Nim][nim] installed on your computer, you can simply run

[nimble install hastyscribe](class:cmd)

### Building from Source

You can also build HastyScribe from source, if there is no pre-built binary for your platform.

First of all you need a [libmarkdown.a](class:file) static library. You can either grab one precompiled (Windows or Mac OS X) from the [vendor]({{repo -> https://github.com/h3rald/hastyscribe}}/blob/master/vendor) folder of the {{hs}} repository or build your own. 

If you choose to build your own:

1. Clone the discount [repository](https://github.com/Orc/discount).
2. In the directory containing the Discount source code, run the following commands:

   > %terminal%
   > ./configure.sh \-\-with-tabstops=2 \-\-with-dl=both \-\-with-id-anchor \-\-with-github-tags \-\-with-fenced-code \-\-enable-all-features
   > 
   > make

   > %tip%
   > Tip
   > 
   > If you are on Windows, you can compile Discount using [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.yaxm.org/doku.php).

Once you have a [libmarkdown.a](class:file) static library for your platform:

1. Download and install [Nim][nim].
2. Clone the HastyScribe [repository](https://github.com/h3rald/hastyscribe).
3. Put your [libmarkdown.a](class:file) file in the [vendor](class:dir) directory.
4. Run [nim c hastyscribe.nim](class:cmd)

## Usage

{{hs}} is a command-line application that can compile one or more Markdown files into one or more HTML files with the same name(s).

### Command Line Syntax

[hastyscribe](class:cmd) _filename-or-glob-expression_ **[** [_<options\>_](class:opt) **]**

Where:

  * _filename-or-glob-expression_ is a valid file or [glob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) expression that will be compiled into HTML.
  * The following options are supported:
    * [\-\-notoc](class:opt) causes {{hs}} to output HTML documents _without_ automatically generated a Table of Contents at the start.
    * [\-\-user-css=<file\>](class:opt) causes {{hs}} inserts the contents of the specified local file as a CSS stylesheet. 
    * [\-\-output-file=<file\>](class:opt) causes {{hs}} to write output to a local file (Use [\-\-output-file=-](class:opt) to output to standard output).

### Linux/OSX Examples 

Executing {{hs}} to compile [my_markdown_file.md](class:file) within the current directory:

> %terminal%
> ./hastyscribe my\_markdown\_file.md
 
Executing {{hs}} to compile all [.md](class:ext) files within the current directory:

> %terminal%
> ./hastyscribe \*.md

### Windows Examples

Executing {{hs}} to compile [my_markdown_file.md](class:file) within the current directory:

> %terminal%
> hastyscribe.exe my\_markdown\_file.md

Executing {{hs}} to compile all [.md](class:ext) files within the current directory:

> %terminal%
> hastyscribe.exe \*.md

> %tip%
> Tip
> 
> You can also drag a Markdown file directly on [hastyscribe.exe](class:kwd) to compile it to HTML.

## Syntax Reference

### Document Headers

{{hs}} supports [Pandoc][pandoc]-style Document Headers, as implemented by the [Discount][discount] library. Basically, you can specify the title of the document, author and date as the first three lines of the document, prepending each with a [%](class:kwd), like this 

~~~
% HastyScribe User Guide
% Fabio Cevasco
% -
~~~

> %warning%
> Important
> 
>  * The order of the document headers is significant.
>  * If you want to use the current date, enter [% -](class:kwd) in the third line.


### Snippets

If you want to reuse a few words or even entire blocks of texts, you can use {{hs}}'s snippets. 

A snippet definition is constituted by an identifier, followed by an arrow (->), followed by some text -- all wrapped in double curly brackets. 

The following definition creates a snippet called [test](class:kwd) which is transformed into the text "This is a test snippet.". 

<code>\{\{test -> This is a test snippet.\}\}</code>

Once a snippet is defined _anywhere_ in the document, you can use its identifier wrapped in double curly brackets (<code>\{\{test}\}\}</code> in the previous example) anywhere in the document to reuse the specified text.

> %note%
> Remarks
> 
> * It doesn't matter where a snippet is defined. Snippets can be used anywhere in the document, before or after their definition.
> * When a document is compiled, both snippets _and snippets definitions_ are evaluated their body text.

### Inline Formatting 

The following table lists all the most common ways to format inline text: 

> %responsive%
>  Source                                             | Output             
> ----------------------------------------------------|--------------------
> `**strong emphasis**` or `__strong emphasis__`      | __strong emphasis__
> `*emphasis*` or `_emphasis_`                        | *emphasis*
> `~~deleted text~~`                                  | ~~deleted text~~
> `<ins>inserted text<ins>`                           | <ins>inserted text</ins>
> ```code` ``                                         | `code`
> `[HTML](abbr:Hypertext Markup Language)`            | [HTML](abbr:Hypertext Markup Language)
> `<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>`                      | <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
> `<mark>marked</mark>`                               | <mark>marked</mark>.
> `Sample output: <samp>This is a test.</samp>`       | Sample output: <samp>This is a test.</samp>
> `Set the variable <var>test</var> to 1.`            | Set the variable <var>test</var> to 1.
> `<q>This is a short quotation</q>`                  | <q>This is a short quotation</q>
> `<cite>Hamlet</cite>, by William Shakespeare.`      | <cite>Hamlet</cite>, by William Shakespeare.
> `A [.md](class:ext) file`                           | A [.md](class:ext) file
> `[my_markdown_file.md](class:file) file`            | [my_markdown_file.md](class:file) file

> %tip%
> Tip
> 
> The [kwd](class:kwd), [opt](class:kwd), [file](class:kwd), [dir](class:kwd), [arg](class:kwd), [tt](class:kwd) and [cmd](class:kwd) are all rendered as inline monospace text. [kwd](class:kwd) and [ext](class:ext) are also rendered in bold.


#### SmartyPants Substitutions

Special characters can be easily entered using some special character sequences.

{{hs}} supports all the sequences supported by [Discount][discount]:

* <code>`` text‘’</code> &rarr; “text”.
* `"double-quoted text"` &rarr; “double-quoted text”
* `'single-quoted text'` &rarr; ‘single-quoted text’
* `don't` &rarr; don’t. as well as anything-else’t. (But foo'tbar is just foo'tbar.)
* `it's` &rarr; it’s, as well as anything-else’s (except not foo'sbar and the like.)
* `(tm)` &rarr; ™
* `(r)` &rarr; ®
* `(c)` &rarr; ©
* `1/4th` &rarr; 1/4th. Same goes for 1/2 and 3/4.
* `...` or `. . .` &rarr; …
* `---` &rarr; —
* `--` &rarr; –
* `A^B` becomes A^B. Complex superscripts can be enclosed in brackets, so `A^(B+2)` &rarr; A^(B+2).


#### Icons

{{hs}} bundles the [FontAwesome][fa] icon font. To prepend an icon to text you can use Discount's _class:_ pseudo-protocol, and specify a valid [fa-*](class:kwd) (non-alias) class.

Examples:

> %responsive%
> Source                                   | Output
> -----------------------------------------|------------
> `[a paper plane](class:fa-paper-plane)` | [ a paper plane](class:fa-paper-plane)
> `[Galactic Empire](class:fa-empire)`    | [ Galactic Empire](class:fa-empire)
> `[Rebel Alliance](class:fa-rebel)`      | [ Rebel Alliance](class:fa-rebel)

> %tip%
> Tip
> 
> See the [FontAwesome Icon Reference][fa-icons] for a complete list of all CSS classes to use for icons (aliases are not supported).

#### Badges

Badges are normally just shorthands for [Icons](#Icons) formatted with different colors. To add a _badge_ to some inline text, use the corresponding class among those listed in the following table. For example, the following code:

    [Genoa, Italy](class:geo)

produces the following result:

[Genoa, Italy](class:geo)

{{hs}} currently supports the following badges:

> %responsive%
> Class                | Badge                        | Class               | Badge

#### HastyScribe Logo

To display the {{hs}} logo, use the [hastyscribe](class:kwd) class, like this:

`[](class:hastyscribe)` &rarr; [](class:hastyscribe)


#### Links

> %responsive%
> Source                                  | Output
> ----------------------------------------|------------
> `[H3RALD](https://h3rald.com/)`         | [H3RALD](https://h3rald.com/)

> `<https://h3rald.com>`                  | <https://h3rald.com> 

Additionally, you can define placeholders for URLs and link titles, like this:

`[h3rald]: https://h3rald.com/ "Fabio Cevasco's Web Site"`

And use them in hyperlinks (note the usage of square brackets instead of round brackets):

`[H3RALD][h3rald]`

### Block-level Formatting

#### Headings

Headings can be specified simply by prepending [#](class:kwd)s to text, as follows: 

~~~
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
~~~

> %note%
> Note
> 
> If you use [Document Headers](#Document.Headers), A [H1](class:kwd) is used for the title of the {{hs}} document. Within the document, start using headings from [H2](class:kwd).

#### Tables

{{hs}} supports [PHP Markdown Extra][pme] table syntax using pipes and dashes.

{{input-text}}

~~~
Column Header 1 | Column Header 2 | Column Header 3 
----------------|-----------------|----------------
Cell 1,1        | Cell 1,2        | Cell 1, 3
Cell 2,1        | Cell 2,2        | Cell 2, 3
Cell 3,1        | Cell 3,2        | Cell 3, 3
~~~

{{output-text}}

Column Header 1 | Column Header 2 | Column Header 3 
----------------|-----------------|----------------
Cell 1,1        | Cell 1,2        | Cell 1, 3
Cell 2,1        | Cell 2,2        | Cell 2, 3
Cell 3,1        | Cell 3,2        | Cell 3, 3

> %note%
> Note
> 
> Multi-row cells are not supported. If you need more complex tables, use HTML code instead.


> %sidebar%
> Responsive Tables
> 
> To make tables responsive, put them in a _responsive_ block, like in the previous example. The [responsive](class:kwd) class causes a table not to shrink and makes it scrollable horizontally on small devices.  

#### Block Quotes

Block quotes can be created simply by prepending a [>](class:kwd) to a line, and they can be nested by prepending additional [>](class:kwd)s.

{{input-text}}

~~~
> This is a block quote.
> > This is a nested quote. 
~~~

{{output-text}}

> This is a block quote.
> > This is a nested quote. 

#### Code Blocks

To format a block of source code, indent it by at least four spaces. Here's the result:

    proc encode_image_file*(file, format): string =
      if (file.existsFile):
        let contents = file.readFile
        return encode_image(contents, format)
      else: 
        echo("Warning: image '"& file &"' not found.")
        return file

Alternatively, you can also use Github-style fenced blocks, by adding three tildes (~~~) before and after the source code. 

> %warning%
> Warning
> 
> {{hs}} does not support syntax highlighting for code blocks. To do so, it would require Javascript and {{hs}} is currently kept purposedly "Javascript-free".


#### Images

{{input-text -> The following HastyScribe Markdown code:}}

~~~
![HastyScribe Logo](../assets/images/hastyscribe.png =221x65)
~~~

{{output-text -> Produces the following output:}}

##### Definition Lists

In some cases you may want to write a list of terms and their corresponding definitions. You could use an ordinary unordered list, but semantically speaking the _proper_ type of list to use in this case is a definition list.

{{input-text}}

~~~
unordered list
: A list for unordered items. Also called _bulleted list_.
ordered list 
: A list for ordered items. Also called _numbered list_.
alphabetical list
: Technically speaking just an ordered list, but formatted with letters instead of numbers
definition list
: A list of terms and definitions.
~~~

{{output-text}}

unordered list
: A list for unordered items. Also called _bulleted list_.
ordered list 
: A list for ordered items. Also called _numbered list_.
alphabetical list
: Technically speaking just an ordered list, but formatted with letters instead of numbers
definition list
: A list of terms and definitions.

Alternatively, you can write the above definition list as follows:

~~~
=unordered list=
  A list for unordered items. Also called _bulleted list_.
=ordered list=
  A list for ordered items. Also called _numbered list_.
=alphabetical list=
  Technically speaking just an ordered list, but formatted with letters instead of numbers
=definition list=
  A list of terms and definitions.
~~~


#### Class Blocks 

##### Notes

[Discount][discount] supports the definition of _class blocks_: [div](class:kwd)s with a class attribute. The syntax is very similar to the one used for [block quotes](#Block.Quotes), with the addition of the class name wrapped in [%](class:kwd)s on the first line. 

In {{hs}}, this syntax is used to produce notes, [tips](#Tips), [warmings](#Warnings), [sidebars](#Sidebars) and [terminal sessions](#Terminal.Sessions).

{{input-text}}

~~~
> %note%
> Note
> 
> This is a note.
~~~

{{output-text}}

> %note%
> Note
> 
> This is a note.

##### Tips

Tips are used for optional information that can help the user in some way. 

{{input-text}}

~~~
> %tip%
> Tip
> 
> This is a tip.
~~~

{{output-text}}

> %tip%
> Tip
> 
> This is a tip.

##### Warnings

Warnings are used for important information the user should not overlook. 

{{input-text}}

~~~
> %warning%
> Warning
> 
> This is a warning or an important note.
~~~

{{output-text}}

> %warning%
> Warning
> 
> This is a warning or an important note.

##### Sidebars

Sidebars are used for digressions and asides. 

{{input-text}}

~~~
> %sidebar%
> This is a _sidebar_
> 
> Although not always placed on the side of the page, _sidebars_ contain additional content and asides.
~~~

{{output-text}}

> %sidebar%
> This is a _sidebar_
> 
> Although not always placed on the side of the page, _sidebars_ contain additional content and asides.


##### Terminal Sessions

Terminal sessions are used to display commands entered in a terminal, in sequence, without displaying their output. 

{{input-text}}

~~~
> %terminal%
> 
> cd src
> 
> ./configure
> 
> make && sudo make install
~~~

{{output-text}}

> %terminal%
> 
> cd src
> 
> ./configure
> 
> make && sudo make install

If commands must be executed as a super-user, use the [terminal-su](class:kwd) class instead:

{{input-text}}

~~~
> %terminal-su%
> 
> shutdown -h now
~~~

{{output-text}}

> %terminal-su%
> 
> shutdown -h now
